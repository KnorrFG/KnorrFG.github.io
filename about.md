<p>
My name is Felix, I've got a diploma in computer science from the TU Dresden,
Germany, and I'm currently doing my PhD in Neuroscience.
</p>
<p>
I learned C when I was 16 years old and adopted to C++ shortly after that. As a
student, I had a research assistant position for 2 years where I wrote
different programs in C++ for video recording, compression, and some
lightweight analysis. During my intern semester, I developed a tool to ease
analysis of electrical signals in animal nerves, and implemented a couple of
time series analysis algorithms. During different practical works in the course
of my study, I worked a lot with Python, which I also have been using in my
diploma thesis, and since in my PhD.
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in programming, AI, statistics and neuroscience. Besides that
I'm also interessted in neutrition and sports, and I love to play Pathfinder.</p>

# My open source projects

* **Pyparadigm** is a Python library which allows to arrange and display visual
  stimuli and react to user-input with minimal amounts of source code in a 
  declarative manner.
